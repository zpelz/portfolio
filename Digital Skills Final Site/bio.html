			<h2>A Little Bit About Me</h2>

			<p>I was born in Cary, North Carolina, in July of 1999. My family lived in California for five years, then moved back to North Carolina, where I attended high school  at Longleaf School of the Arts. There I was able to take classes in dance, art history, and music theory, while practicing fine arts and playing the bassoon. 
			<br/>
			<br/>
			After high school, I began working towards my undergraduate degree at American University, where I am currently majoring in Communications and minoring in Graphic Design. Recently, I have been able to put these skills to use in my position as the Digital Design Assistant at the Office of Campus Life at AU. In this new job, I am responsible for designing layouts and templates for digital signage systems across AU’s campus, as well as some minor website design and maintenance. 
			<br/>
			<br/>
			When I am not at work or in class, I like to play bass, watch Netflix, or think about what color I’m going to dye my hair next. Fun fact: my hair has been every color of the rainbow. This is a subtle nod to the fact that I am, indeed, a huge lesbian.</p>
